# Documentation Practice for OpenAir Projects
Good documentation practice for OpenAir open hardware projects. _This repository is a work in progress!_

### A checklist for ensuring your repository's documentation is complete 
This checklist is adapted from the article templates for [_HardwareX_](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3364474).
- [ ] Is the subject of the submission under an open source license?
- [ ] Are design files in the preferred format for making modifications as defined by the [Open Source Hardware definition](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/)?
- [ ] Can the hardware be reproduced with the details provided in the repository?
- [ ] Are all relevant design files available in the repository? Are they described in a README, and clearly documented? (_e.g._, descriptive file names, commented code, labeled images, etc.) 
- [ ] Are visual instructions used when necessary?
- [ ] Is the utility of the hardware to the scientific community explained clearly? Has a specific scientific application been demonstrated using the hardware?
- [ ] Is the performance of the hardware adequately demonstrated and characterized? (Are data demonstrating the hardware performance, such as .csv files, lab notes and graphs, included in the repository or posted to a FAIR repository and cited?)
- [ ] Are all potential safety concerns addressed?
- [ ] Has all [personally identifiable information (PII)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii) and sensitive information (such as passwords) been removed?
- [ ] Are all comments and inline notes necessary and [appropriate](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/11/overly-honest-references-should-we-cite-the-crappy-gabor-paper-here/)? Keep in mind that the repository will be *permanent.*


### A checklist for making your repository FAIR and cross-referenced
- [ ] Make sure your repository is ready to share openly and permanently (see notes on PII, comments above)
- [ ] Make sure your README is clear and includes the OpenAir logo and a clear statement of what your project does and what its state of development is
- [ ] Pick an open hardware license at https://www.choosealicense.org and save it as a *License.txt* file
- [ ] Add your repository to the OpenAir Github Community
- [ ] Get ORCID accounts for as many authors as possible at orcid.org
- [ ] As the project maintainer, set up an account on www.zenodo.org, and connect it to your ORCID account.
- [ ] Implement Zenodo/Github sync for your repository
- [ ] Issue a release on Github. (v.0.0.1 is a good tag to use when starting out.) This will generate a Zenodo repository and give you a DOI
- [ ] Add authorship information to Zenodo repository, including ORCIDs for all authors and contributors
- [ ] Add your Zenodo repository to the OpenAir Zenodo community
- [ ] Add a `CITATION.cff` file to your Github repository which includes the Zenodo DOI
- [ ] Add the DOI badge for your repository to Github. (You can copy Markdown code for this from the right sidebar on Zenodo)
- [ ] Add the correct hardware license to the metadata of your Zenodo repository
- [ ] If applicable, add relevant funding sources (e.g., NSF grants) to the metadata of your Zenodo repository
- [ ] _OPTIONAL:_ Apply to the Open Source Hardware Association for an OSHWA ID. (That isn't implemented in this repository because it isn't hardware, but you can see an example here: https://certification.oshwa.org/us002582.html)
- [ ] _OPTIONAL:_ If you receive an OSHWA ID, add the logo to your README on Github and add the number to your Zenodo repository as an Alternate Identifier.

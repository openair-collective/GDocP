# Documentation Standards for OpenAir Projects
Good documentation practice for OpenAir open hardware projects. _This repository is a work in progress!_

# A checklist for your repository
- [ ] Make sure your repository is ready to share openly and permanently
- [ ] Make sure your README is clear and includes the OpenAir logo and a clear statement of what your project does and what its state of development is
- [ ] Pick an open hardware license at www.choosealicense.org and save it as a *License.txt* file
- [ ] Add your repository to the OpenAir Github Community
- [ ] Get ORCID accounts for as many authors as possible at orcid.org
- [ ] As the project maintainer, set up an account on www.zenodo.org, and connect it to your ORCID account.
- [ ] Implement Zenodo/Github sync for your repository
- [ ] Issue a release on Github. (v.0.0.1 is a good tag to use when starting out.) This will generate a Zenodo repository and give you a DOI
- [ ] Add authorship information to Zenodo repository, including ORCIDs for all authors and contributors
- [ ] Add your Zenodo repository to the OpenAir Zenodo community
- [ ] Add a `CITATION.cff` file to your Github repository which includes the Zenodo DOI
- [ ] Add the DOI badge for your repository to Zenodo
- [ ] _OPTIONAL:_ Apply to the Open Source Hardware Association for an OSHWA ID. (That isn't implemented in this repository because it isn't hardware, but you can see an example here: https://certification.oshwa.org/us002582.html)
- [ ] _OPTIONAL:_ If you receive an OSHWA ID, add the logo to your README on Github and add the number to your Zenodo repository as an Alternate Identifier.
